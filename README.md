## Description

FOODI is an innovative platform designed to revolutionize the food ordering experience by combining standard food ordering with personalized meal customization. Users can either order meals directly from the menu or create custom dishes by specifying details like the dish's name, ingredients, image, and quantity. Custom dish requests need to be submitted at least two days in advance for restaurant owners to evaluate feasibility and pricing. Additionally, FOODI offers a streamlined process for individuals to apply as delivery drivers, with admin approval or rejection notifications sent via email.

The platform enables restaurant owners to efficiently manage orders, custom dish requests, menus, and delivery drivers. FOODIâ€™s goal is to enhance the food delivery experience by adding more flexibility and personalization for users while simplifying the management tasks for restaurant owners and drivers.
